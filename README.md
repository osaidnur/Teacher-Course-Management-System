## 🏗️ Class Structure

The system comprises two primary classes:

1. **Course**:
   - Attributes:
     - `name`: Department short name (e.g., "COMP").
     - `id`: Course ID (e.g., 2310).
   - Methods:
     - Constructors: Default and parameterized.
     - Getters and setters for all attributes.
     - `printInfo()`: Displays course details.

2. **Teacher**:
   - Attributes:
     - `name`: Teacher's name.
     - `id`: Teacher's ID number.
     - `basicSalary`: Base salary.
     - `extraPaymentRate`: Rate for extra payments.
     - `coursesTaught`: Array of `Course` objects.
   - Methods:
     - Constructors: Default and parameterized.
     - Getters and setters for all attributes.
     - `printInfo()`: Displays teacher details.
     - `countCourseLevel(int level)`: Returns the number of courses at a specified level.
     - `calculateExtraPayment()`: Computes extra payment based on courses taught.

The `Main` class serves as the driver, facilitating user interaction through a menu-driven interface.
